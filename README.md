Task Overview
A FastAPI-based user management API has implemented JWT-based authentication with role enforcement on specific endpoints. After a recent configuration update, all protected endpoints now return HTTP 401 Unauthorized errorsâ€”valid tokens are always rejected. Your task is to diagnose and fix the JWT authentication system so that authorized users can access protected endpoints, and role-based access control is correctly enforced.

Guidance
- Review the application's authentication logic, especially how JWT tokens are issued and validated
- Inspect recent configuration values and handling of secrets and algorithms
- Ensure role checks are enforced after successful JWT authentication
- Verify that valid JWT tokens, when presented by users with correct roles, are accepted and allow access
- No new dependencies should be added; the solution must work with the existing stack

Objectives
- Diagnose why valid JWT tokens are being rejected with HTTP 401
- Implement the required fix so that JWT authentication works as intended
- Ensure endpoints only allow access to users with valid, unexpired JWTs
- Validate that role-based restrictions are properly enforced on limited endpoints

How to Verify
- Use the API to obtain a JWT token as a registered user
- Access protected endpoints with a valid token and confirm successful responses
- Ensure endpoints return 401 for invalid or expired tokens, and 403 for insufficient roles
- Confirm all authentication and role enforcement tests pass and the API operates securely
